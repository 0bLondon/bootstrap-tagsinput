# Bootstrap Tags Input [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TimSchlechter/bootstrap-tagsinput.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TimSchlechter/bootstrap-tagsinput)
Bootstrap Tags Input is a JQuery based plugin providing a Twitter 
Bootstrap-like user interface for adding tags.

## Usage
Examples can be found [here](http://timschlechter.github.com/bootstrap-tagsinput/).

## What makes this tags input different

### Objects as tags
Not just support for using strings! This means you can use different values
for a tag's label and value. Each tag also holds a reference to the object
by which it was created, so by calling <code>tagsinput('items')</code> an
array of the original items is returned.
  
### True multivalue support
Other implementations just concatenate the values to a comma separated string.
This results in <code>val()</code> returning just this string, and when
submitting the form, only one big, concatenated value is sent in the request.

Bootstrap Tags Input provides true multivalue support. Just use a 
<code>&lt;select multiple /&gt;</code> as your input element, and 
<code>val()</code> will return an array of the tag values. When submitting the
form, an array of values will be sent with the request.

### Typeahead support
Integrates with Twitter Bootstraps's typeahead.
